What This Tool Does

This code analyzes a volume mesh, checking for topological validity,
positive cell volumes, size ratio for adjacent cells, dihedral angles,
and distortion of quadrilateral faces.  Also, mesh length scale
perpendicular to the surface and along the surface are assessed.
Finally, if a Pointwise nmb file and the Pointwise GEODE library are
available, the distance from mesh points that should be on the geometry
to the actual geometry is assessed.

Much of the code is multi-threaded for speed (since the assessments are
embarassingly parallel, this is easy to do safely).  Also, to the extent
possible, the code operates on data streamed from disk rather than
reading the entire mesh into memory at once.

The topology checks are the biggest user of memory, because those checks
work by trying to match up the two copies of a triangular or
quadrilateral face.  Before beginning this process, an estimate of
required memory is done.  If this requirement is too large a fraction of
machine memory, a slower, less memory intensive variant of the algorithm
is invoked.

Mesh I/O is done using a plug-in architecture.  For a given file type,
there are a total of four functions that must be implemented:
